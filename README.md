# CS300Courses

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
The problem was that the ABCU needed a program that allowed processing a csv of courses offered. The csv contains the course number, name, and any prerequisite courses
required to take the course. The program needed to print all of the courses in alphanumeric order. It needed to have search capabilities to find a specific course if it existed.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
I started by evaluating the requirements of the program and analyzing different data structures to determine which would be the best option best on pros and cons of each, and
how they could be applied to the program. This analysis included time complexity to determine which would be the optimal option overall.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
The main roadblock was building the parser from scratch since it required me to keep in mind different ways that parsing a csv file could fail. The other difficult part was creating the course
objects as I was parsing the csv file. This part was crucial since the rest of the program depends on the parsing function working properly.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
This project has helped me be more conscious of the importance of picking data structures wisely to ensure a program is efficient and scales well. It has helped me value having the foresight
to anticipate issues a program may have in the future to allow for a more flexible solution.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
This program has helped me improve how I write code so it is more concise yet easy to understand. It is important to strike a balance between being too verbose and being too clever. Noth affect readability.
It has also made more conscious about using comments to point out certain parts of the code that could use more detail to describe its importance.
